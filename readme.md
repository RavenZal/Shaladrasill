# 🎨 TinyShader

> A from-scratch CPU software rasterizer — no OpenGL, no GPU, just math and pixels.

**TinyShader** renders 3D models entirely on the CPU. It reads OBJ geometry and TGA textures, transforms vertices through a full graphics pipeline, rasterizes triangles by hand, shades every pixel with tangent-space normal mapping and Phong lighting, casts shadows, and applies screen-space ambient occlusion — all in C++.

Built following the [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) tutorial series.

## ✨ Features

| Category | What's implemented |
|---|---|
| **Coordinate pipeline** | `Object → Eye → Clip → NDC → Screen` via `ModelView × Perspective × Viewport` |
| **Rasterizer** | Barycentric triangle coverage, Z-buffer depth test, `IShader` programmable interface |
| **Shading** | Phong specular (not Blinn-Phong) with ambient + diffuse + specular terms |
| **Normal mapping** | Tangent-space TBN matrix; samples from tangent normal map, transforms to view space |
| **Shadow mapping** | Light-view depth pass → per-pixel visibility query with depth bias |
| **SSAO** | Screen-space hemisphere sampling, view-position reconstruction, range-based weighting, bias guard |
| **Perspective correction** | `1/w` interpolation for shadow coordinates and camera normals |
| **Textures** | TGA I/O (RGB + grayscale), BGRA-aware sampling with UV flipping |

## 🔧 Build & Run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/TinyShader
```

> Run from the project root — asset paths are relative.

Requires a **C++17** compiler. No external dependencies beyond the standard library.

## 📐 Coordinate Spaces at a Glance

| Space | How we get there |
|---|---|
| **Object** | Raw OBJ vertex positions |
| **Eye (View)** | `ModelView × object` |
| **Clip** | `Perspective × eye` — 4D homogeneous, **keep `w`** |
| **NDC** | `clip / clip.w` — perspective divide |
| **Screen** | `Viewport × ndc` — pixel grid |

## 🔬 Key Algorithms

**SSAO** — Reconstructs view-space position from screen `(x, y, depth)`, generates a 32-sample hemisphere kernel oriented to the surface normal via a TBN-style frame, projects each sample back to screen space, and compares depth. A range-based falloff weight (`1 − dist/radius`) prevents distant surfaces from counting as occluders.

**Shadow Test** — Transforms the shaded point into light clip space, applies perspective divide + viewport, then compares against the light's Z-buffer. Points behind the stored depth are in shadow (visibility = 0.05).

**TBN Construction** — `T` and `B` are derived from triangle edges and UV deltas in view space; `N` is the interpolated vertex normal. The tangent normal map sample `(nx, ny, nz)` becomes `T·nx + B·ny + N·nz`.

## 🧪 SSAO Kernel (visual intuition)

```
         N (surface normal)
         │  ● sample (in hemisphere)
         │ ╱
    ─────●─────  surface
```

Kernel samples are randomly placed in a unit hemisphere, scaled by an accelerating curve (`lerp(0.1, 1.0, i²/n²)`), then aligned to the surface normal. This biases samples closer to the center for more relevant occlusion.
